            <p>Hurricane Marie is tied as the seventh-most intense Pacific hurricane on record, attaining a barometric
                pressure of 918 mbar in August 2014. At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds
                spanned an area 575 miles (925 km) across. Although its center remained well away from land, its large
                size created dangerous surf from Southwestern Mexico to southern California. Off the coast of Los Cabos,
                three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas. In Colima and Oaxaca, heavy rains and
                flooding from outer bands caused two fatalities. Toward the end of August, swells of 10 to 15 ft (3.0 to
                4.6 m), the largest seen from a hurricane in decades, battered coastlines in southern California, with
                structural damage on Santa Catalina Island and in the Greater Los Angeles Area. A breakwater near Long
                Beach sustained $10 million worth of damage, with portions gouged out. One person drowned in the surf
                near Malibu. Hundreds of ocean rescues, including over 100 in Malibu alone, were attributed to the
                storm, and overall losses reached $20 million. </p>
